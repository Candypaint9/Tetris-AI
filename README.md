# Tetris AI
<h2>Overview</h2>
This project implements an AI agent that plays Tetris by taking real-time decisions using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. The goal is to evolve neural networks that can effectively learn and improve their gameplay over generations.
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Tetris Environment:</b>  A simulated Tetris game where the AI agent makes decisions.</li>
  <li><b>NEAT Implementation:</b>  Uses the NEAT algorithm to evolve neural network controllers.</li>
  <li></li><b>Real-Time Decision Making: </b>The evolved agent makes gameplay decisions based on the current Tetris board state.</li>
</ul>
